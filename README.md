# Homework 5
Contained within this repository are several files that you will either need to run or edit:
* Problem 1 requires you to create and edit the `Dockerfile` in `Docker_Materials`
* `Prob2.sql` needs to be edited and run, and defines several tables and is where you can add your column names, data types, and constraints. `Successful_Inserts.sql` should then be run to populate your tables. All of these queries should be run once and should complete successfully. If not, something has gone wrong with your initial table creation.
* `Prob3_Failures.md` is a markdown template consisting of a collection of queries that should fail when run. For each failing query, you are to specify exactly what constraint is causing the failure and why.
* `Prob4_Failures.md` is a markdown template consisting of a collection of queries that should fail when run. For each failing query, you are to specify exactly what constraint or constraints are problematic and why.
