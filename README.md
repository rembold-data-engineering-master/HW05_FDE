# Homework 5
Contained within this repository are three `.sql` files:
* `Prob1.sql` starts off a few tables and is what you can add your column names, data types, and constraints to
* `Prob1_Successes.sql` add data to the tables that you create in `Prob1.sql`. All of these queries should be run once and should complete successfully. If not, something has gone wrong with your initial table creation.
* `Prob1_Failures.sql` is a collection of queries that should fail when run. For each failing query, you are to specify exactly what constraint is causing the failure.
