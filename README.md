# Homework 5
Contained within this repository are several files that you will either need to run or edit:
* `Prob1.md` needs to be edited to include your custom bash prompt command
* You need to upload all 9 files created as part of Problem 2
* `Prob3.sql` needs to be edited and run, and defines several tables and is where you can add your column names, data types, and constraints
* `Prob3_Successes.sql` needs only to be run. It adds data to the tables that you create in `Prob3.sql`. All of these queries should be run once and should complete successfully. If not, something has gone wrong with your initial table creation.
* `Prob3_Failures.md` is a markdown template consisting of a collection of queries that should fail when run. For each failing query, you are to specify exactly what constraint is causing the failure and why.
