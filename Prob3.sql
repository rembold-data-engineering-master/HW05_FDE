You will need to fill out the necessary tables below given the Entity-Relationship
Diagram shown in the PDF (and included in the repository) and other specified constraints
as described in the PDF. You may have to try several times to get your table creation
correct, so I have set up this template to automatically drop any old tables each time
to give you a fresh start.
